# Hydrabase - WIP

Hydrabase is web-of-trust inspired consensus-less distributed relational database. The networks primary purpose is to act as a unified source that propagates music metadata.

## Install

### Docker

```yml
services:
  hydrabase:
    image: ghcr.io/quixthe2nd/hydrabase
    container_name: hydrabase
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 4545:4545/tcp
      - 45454:45454/udp
    volumes:
      - ./data:/app/data
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      # Uncomment to enable Spotify plugin:
      # SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID: $SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID
      # SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET: $SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET
      # Ports
      DHT_PORT: 45454
      SERVER_PORT: 4545
      # Use `openssl rand -hex 16` to generate an api key
      # API_KEY: $API_KEY
      # Used for testing
      # DUMMY_NODES: 0
```

### Manual

To install:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/QuixThe2nd/Hydrabase
cd Hydrabase
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun src
```

## API Documentation

To make an API request, you need to connect to a Hydrabase node via WebSocket. Connect to `ws://ip_address:4545` with the `x-api-key` header set.

### Requests

Once connected to a node, you can trigger searches by sending a message structured like so:
```json
{
  "request": {
    "type": "artist" | "track" | "album",
    "query": "black eyed peas"
  }
}
```

The Hydrabase node will respond with results.

You can optionally (and should) set a nonce like so:
```json
{
  "request": {
    "type": "artist" | "track" | "album",
    "query": "black eyed peas"
  },
  "nonce": 20
}
```

This nonce can be any number, but should be unique to that request. That way when the server responds, you know which request it's for:
```json
{
  "response": [
    {
      "id": "360391",
      "name": "Black Eyed Peas",
      "popularity": 0,
      "genres": [ "Pop" ],
      "followers": 0,
      "image_url": "",
      "external_urls": {},
      "plugin_id": "iTunes"
    },
    {
      "id": "1yxSLGMDHlW21z4YXirZDS",
      "name": "Black Eyed Peas",
      "popularity": 81,
      "genres": [],
      "followers": 10041814,
      "image_url": "https://i.scdn.co/image/ab6761610000e5ebb3037310c07b99cbefbd2c6d",
      "external_urls": { "spotify": "https://open.spotify.com/artist/1yxSLGMDHlW21z4YXirZDS" },
      "plugin_id": "Spotify"
    }
  ],
  "nonce": 20
}
```

## Networking

Currently Hydrabase needs 2 ports forwarded:
```
TCP: 4545 (WebSocket - Used to communicate with peers)
UDP: 45454 (DHT - Used to discover peers)
```

Hydrabase will automatically try to forward required ports using uPnP, but manual port forwarding is recommended. Hydrabase will not work without port forwarding enabled.

## How it Works

As Hydrabase is under active development, this section will be incomplete. Here is what is currently functional:

### Peer Discovery

#### DHT

Hydrabase nodes connect to BitTorrent's DHT network and query it for an infohash for a torrent that doesn't exist, then announce that they're seeding it. This infohash can be anything, as long as all peers use the same one. This allows for peers to find each other without a centralised tracker or signalling server.

#### Gossip Network

Each time 2 Hydrabase nodes create a connection, they announce each other to all known peers. This acts as a more reliable peer discovery network, using DHT as a bootstrap network.

### Local Metadata Lookups

Hydrabase nodes can run plugins. For now, only iTunes & Spotify plugins exist. These plugins expose a `search` function which is used to search external metadata providers directly for music.

### Remote Metadata Lookups

Hydrabase nodes can query their peers to lookup metadata for them. This will trigger a local lookup on the peer's end with the results relayed.

### Confidence Scoring
A score is calculated that represents your confidence/trust in a peer's response. This aims to represent the odds that a peer is lying to you. Currently, this is calculated by comparing the results for plugins you and your peer share in common. By default, a confidence score of 1 means that for all information you can verify, you have no reason to believe they're lying. While 0 means that all the results they gave you were inconsistent with what you can verify with a local lookup.

### Peer Reputation
Historic peer responses are kept track of, like a ledger of votes. This is used to weigh votes when deciding on the "correct" response. Aka, peers that we have a longer history with are more trustworthy that newer peers.

### Identities
Each Hydrabase has it's own public key used to identify itself. This is currently used to de-duplicate peers and to avoid connecting to self. In the future identities will be used to permanently keep track of peer reputation.

### Cache Layer
Metadata discovered via API lookups is stored in a database. The cache layer for now is write-only, meaning songs, artists, and albums discovered via plugin lookups are cached, but this cache isn't used. In the future the cache will obviously be used. In the future the cache layer will also store peer responses so you can build up a database of metadata for songs that you normally wouldn't have access to.

### Future Plans
While everything listed above is working, Hydrabase is very incomplete. I scatter `TODO`s throughout the code, so if you're super curious, I've listed technical next-steps. But at a high level, most my focus is on improving the confidence scoring mechanism. The end goal is for peers running different plugins to benefit by exchanging api responses from different metadata providers.
